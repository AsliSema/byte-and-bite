## Project Design

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

We began the project design phase by creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database structure. The ERD helps us understand the relationships between different entities and how data flows through the system.
Here's a simplified representation of ERD design:

### Architecture Design

Our project's architecture was meticulously planned to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficient performance. We designed a high-level overview of the routes and endpoints that we implemented to provide a seamless user experience. The architecture encompasses:

- **User Authentication:** Implemented using Passport.js with Google strategy.
- **Routes and Endpoints:** Defined clear routes and endpoints for user authentication, dish management, orders, and user profiles.
- **Database Integration:** Utilized MongoDB to store user data, dishes, and order information.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Created a separate route for Admin to manage dishes and orders.

Here's a simplified representation of our architecture:
